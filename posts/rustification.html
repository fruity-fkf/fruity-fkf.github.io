        <h1>Hoi..</h1>
<h2>How did we get here….</h2>
<hr />
<p>So recently I was wondering what it'd be like to use Rust. IDK why….I
just had the urge to try rust.</p>
<p>Then something weird happened. I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFkGNe4oaKk">No boilerplate video where they
made a rust-only based command line
envirorment.</a> So zellij for
the terminal multiplexer, Nu for the shell, Helix for the editor among
many others. That made me wonder what the future of the command line
would look like. So since then I had that thought in my head. Then two
or three days later I got another video suggestion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br3GIIQeefY">for learning rust in
a 10 minute video or so.</a>
That reignited the will to try out an all rust dev system. So that's
how I ended up writing this….</p>
<h2>The challange:</h2>
<p>For the next month I will limit myself to using as many rust based tools
as possible. Such as helix for code editing, nu as the shell and things
like that. I will also try to only code my projects in rust and try to
learn rust in general. And the main thing I will try to do is to
document as much of the project as possible and then publish it.</p>
<h2>The setup:</h2>
<p>I'm on NixOS. I manage my config files via home manager. so every app
was configured by it. The config is available on my github. I am using
Nushell with the carapace backend/completion engine( IDK what to call it
honestly… ) and starship as my prompt.</p>
<p>I am also using Kitty as my terminal and Helix as my editor with Gruvbox
as the theme everywhere….</p>
<p>So uhhh….That's all for now I guess</p>
